# ForkBot
Automated forking bot for GitHub

## Overview
This bot is designed to interface with keyboard and mouse input of user. It will record and play keypresses that will land on fork button.

### How does this work?
It will automatically seek for any occurrences of "Fork" button on current screen. It will also store mouse press coordinates of tabs, or will use Alt-Tab to switch between windows. Based on AutoHotkey.

### Inspirations
I was looking at a really crappy MapleStory bot which works by seeking for GUI elements and clicking them in sequence.
